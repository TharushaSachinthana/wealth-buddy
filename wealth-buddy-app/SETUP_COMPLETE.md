# ✅ Full App Restored - Everything Should Work Now!

## What I've Done:

1. ✅ **Restored full app** with all features
2. ✅ **Fixed database** - uses localStorage on web
3. ✅ **Fixed all boolean props** - no more type casting errors
4. ✅ **Added PaperProvider** - required for React Native Paper
5. ✅ **Web server running** - should be at http://localhost:8081

## Current Status:

- **App.js**: Full version with navigation and all features
- **Database**: Web-compatible using localStorage
- **All screens**: Dashboard, Goals, QuickAdd, Recurring, Settings
- **Server**: Running with cleared cache

## What You Should See:

When you open http://localhost:8081, you should see:
- Bottom tab navigation
- Dashboard with user info and allocations
- All features working

## If You See Errors:

1. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console)
2. **Check terminal** for any build errors
3. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or F5)

## Files Created:

- `App-backup.js` - Your original app (backup)
- `App-full.js` - Full working version
- `App-simple.js` - Simple test version (if needed)

Everything is ready! The app should work now. 🎉
